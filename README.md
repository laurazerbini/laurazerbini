<h1> ✨ Hello, world! I'm Laura [she/her] ✨ </h1>
<h3> Full Stack developer and passionate about creative problem solving. </h3>
<h2>•About Me•</h2>
<p>👩🏻‍💻 | It took me a while to find out that code was what I wanted to do for life. I graduated in Fashion Design and worked in the field for a few years before falling in love with the infitine possibilites in the digital environment and in the tech industry.</p>
<p>📚 | I believe that coding is not only... code. I love studying about self development, productivity and personal growth, and I believe that all of this can help me improve my learning path.</p>
<p>💼 | Currently I am working at a Berlin based fintech but not with coding yet. I am soon concluding the bootcamp program I joined last January and look forward to the carrers change.</p>
<p>🥑 | I am also passionate about a helathy lifestyle (and avocados). The words holy, whole, healthy and hale all stemmed from the same root and I believe that what we eat, what we think and the way we put our body into movement are essential for a whole well being.</p>
<h2>•Tech Stack•</h2>
<p>⚙️ | HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails.</p>
